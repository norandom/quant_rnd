**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis: An Overview**

**Concept**:  
DCF is a valuation method used to estimate the intrinsic value of an investment, such as a company or project, by discounting its projected future cash flows to their present value. The core principle is that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.

**Key Components**:
1. **Cash Flow Projections**:  
   - Forecast annual free cash flows (FCF) for a period (e.g., 5–10 years). FCF represents cash generated after operating expenses and capital expenditures.
   
2. **Discount Rate**:  
   - Typically the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which reflects the required return by debt and equity holders. Other rates (e.g., hurdle rate) may be used depending on context.

3. **Terminal Value (TV)**:  
   - Accounts for cash flows beyond the projection period. Common methods include:
     - **Gordon Growth Model**: TV = \(\frac{FCF_n \times (1 + g)}{r - g}\), where \(g\) is perpetual growth rate.
     - **Exit Multiple**: Applies an industry multiple (e.g., EBITDA) to the final year’s metric.

**Steps to Calculate DCF**:
1. **Project Cash Flows**: Estimate annual FCF for the explicit forecast period.
2. **Determine Discount Rate**: Use WACC or a risk-adjusted rate.
3. **Discount Cash Flows**: Calculate present value (PV) of each year’s FCF using \(PV = \frac{CF}{(1 + r)^n}\).
4. **Estimate Terminal Value**: Apply the Gordon Growth Model or exit multiple to the final year.
5. **Discount Terminal Value**: Bring TV to present value using \(\frac{TV}{(1 + r)^n}\).
6. **Sum Values**: Total DCF = PV of projected cash flows + PV of TV.

**Example**:  
A project with 5-year FCF of $1M/year, 10% discount rate, and 3% perpetual growth:  
- **PV of Annual Cash Flows**: ~$3.79M (sum of individual discounted values).  
- **Terminal Value**: \(TV = \frac{$1M \times 1.03}{0.10 - 0.03} ≈ $14.714M\), discounted to ~$9.15M.  
- **Total DCF Value**: ~$12.94M.

**Applications**:  
- Valuing businesses, projects, or assets.  
- Informing investment decisions, mergers and acquisitions, and capital budgeting.

**Limitations**:  
- **Sensitivity to Assumptions**: Small changes in growth rates, discount rates, or cash flows significantly impact results.  
- **Terminal Value Dominance**: TV often comprises a large portion of total value, increasing reliance on long-term assumptions.  
- **Complexity**: Requires accurate forecasts and appropriate discount rate selection.

**Conclusion**:  
DCF provides a fundamental, forward-looking valuation but demands rigorous analysis of assumptions. It is most effective when paired with sensitivity analysis to assess how changes in inputs affect the outcome.

Claude's Final Answer:
Based on the reasoning provided, here's how we can determine if a DCF valuation of $12.94M is correct for the given example:

Let's verify the calculation steps:

1. **Annual Cash Flows** ($1M for 5 years, 10% discount rate):
PV = $1M × [1/(1.1)¹ + 1/(1.1)² + 1/(1.1)³ + 1/(1.1)⁴ + 1/(1.1)⁵]
= $1M × [0.9091 + 0.8264 + 0.7513 + 0.6830 + 0.6209]
= $1M × 3.7907
= $3.79M

2. **Terminal Value**:
Using Gordon Growth Model:
TV = $1M × (1.03)/(0.10 - 0.03)
= $1.03M/0.07
= $14.714M

3. **Present Value of Terminal Value**:
PV of TV = $14.714M/(1.1)⁵
= $14.714M × 0.6209
= $9.15M

4. **Total DCF Value**:
= PV of Cash Flows + PV of Terminal Value
= $3.79M + $9.15M
= $12.94M

Therefore, $12.94M is the correct answer. This checks out because:
- The math follows the proper DCF methodology
- The components (PV of cash flows and terminal value) are calculated correctly
- The final sum matches the stated total
- The terminal value represents about 71% of the total value, which is reasonable for a DCF calculation
